jeb_curious #faq: Posting in the Multiplayer (LFG) channels requires the Proven Adventurer role. However, you can still read messages in these channels and DM people that are looking to play if you are not a Proven Adventurer yet. You can also use the official server list of Minecraft presented by GAMERSAFER to find servers to play on: https://findmcserver.com/

For more info on getting the role and using LFG, please refer to questions 3 and 4 of the #faq.
